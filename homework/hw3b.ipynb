    "This assignment transitions you from NumPy's numerical array operations to Pandas' powerful tabular data manipulation. While NumPy excels at homogeneous numerical arrays, Pandas is designed for the heterogeneous, labeled data that characterizes most real-world datasets—mixing dates, categories, numbers, and text within the same table.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll work with real bike share data from Chicago's Divvy system to answer questions about urban transportation patterns. Through three progressively complex problems—exploring usage patterns, analyzing rider behavior, and conducting temporal analysis—you'll discover why Pandas has become the standard tool for data analysis in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment emphasizes Pandas' design philosophy: named column access, explicit indexing methods (loc/iloc), handling missing data, and method chaining for readable data pipelines. You'll also see how Pandas builds on NumPy while adding the structure and convenience needed for practical data science work.\n",

    "3. This custom index is very useful in case of creating database. For example, I am creating a database for 100 people where I want to know their names, age, color tone, race, etc. If I use default numbers for this attributes it is very difficult to decrypt data for particular person. Custom indexing with columns as attribute names are very helpful in this case."

    "1. Pandas assigned `object` type for both `started_at` and `member_casual` in Task 2a. However, `started_at` is basically a datetime data. Since it is assigned as `object`, it can not perform datetime operations. For example anything related to date and time, it is not possible to do without changing the type. Again, for `member_casual` it has only two type either `member` or `casual`. So, keeping it as object type data is just waste of memory.\n",
    "2. The station ID fields look like the git commit IDs. These look like the cryptographic hashes. These are not any sequential numbers. These are more like unique identifiers to identify the unique station with cryptic hashes instead of disclosing the full details of that particular station.\n",
    "3. Here df is a DataFrame. And isna() function basically finds the NAN values present in each column of the data frame and returns a boolean array basically DataFrame containing the True/False value in each column. And sum() function calculates the total number of NAN values present in each column.\n",
    "4.  Every place in this earth will have its own coordinate. That's why there is 0% missing value. However, it is possible that the rider started the journey outside the station or ended the journey outside station or both. So, it can have missing values. If station field is a critical attribute for my analysis, I have to drop that row to not to corrupt the data. But if coordinates values are enough for data analysis or machine learning result, I can neglect the missing values in station fields and get done with the coordinates result since it will be there always."

    "In 2a.3 the total memory usage is 57.16MB and in 2b.3 the total memory usage is 14.46 MB. This is mainly because of the data type changing. Normally pandas evaluate category type data as integer codes and this ultimately reduces the repeated calculation of strings. So it reduces the memory usage. Again, datetime64[ns] is also considered as 64 bits integers. So, it is also memory efficient than the object type data.\n",
    "So, for df.info() it gives the basic information about the dataframe which ultimately is an approximation. So it is almost rounded result. On the other hand, memormy_usage(deep=true) this means this offer deep and accurate result. Since, both of them work differently from each other, the numbers are different. If datasize is a concern, it is better to use memory_usage(deep=true) since it is more accurate and we can change the object  type to category and datetime like I did in 2b.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since already 30% of the RAM is consumed by the operating system itself, the available RAM is 16*0.7 = 11.2 GB. If I consider 5x(optimistic) datasize then the maximum dataset size is 11.2/5 = 2.24 GB. If I consider 10x (Conservative) datasize then the maximum dataset size is 11.2/10 = 1.12GB. It is always better to be conservative then optimistic. If the system is good it can work on both in optimistic and conservative manner but if the system is itself not that good then it will slow down or stop operating when 5x dataset manner is applied. So I will recommend the maximum dataset size to be 1.12GB."

    "1. `isin()` is more efficient than manual comparison. It can execute faster. Even with large datasets like 20+ stations, the code remains compact and it makes the code run faster. So, large dataset is not a problem at all. But think about using large dataset and manual comparison operation like `&` or `|` or something else. It will take too much time to write the code, the system will take longer duration to execute and even for another programmer it is clumsy to interpret the code.\n",
    "2. We initialized the code with \"Midday\" to give every row of the datasheet a default value. If we set rush hour before and then assigned \"Midday\" it was possible that even the rush hour rows get overwritten and becomes \"Midday\" which is wrong. So, assigning the hour with order is very important. We can update the rush hour later by giving the conditions which we did. But doing the reverse would provide wrong output.\n",
    "3. It is easier to write with `query()` when the logic is not complex or does not have too many varibles. It is readable and concise and faster as well. However, if we have some complex logic or some nested conditions where too many variables have to be considered for answering the questions or finding the specific  data, it is better to go with boolean indexing.\n"
